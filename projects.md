## Research

#### Disentanglement & Deep Learning

Disentanglement is the problem of separating multiple signals from a mixed dataset. It is hugely important for the advancement of general AI, as it entails the ability humans have to treat objects in the world as abstractions of the representations we see. 

Some of the topics I am working on: Disentanglement of Deterministic Finite Automata, Disentanglement applied to Abstract Reasoning, Disentanglement of Visual Representations.

## Projects

### Personal

#### [Robin]()

Robin is an on-going effort in proactive suicide prevention. A collaborator and I compiled a scraped a dataset of over a million Reddit posts, inspired by the classifications of online text about suicide found in Psychological literature. We fine-tuned state of the art natural language processing models to detect suicidal text, and are working on creating a web extension to promote proactive suicide prevention online.

#### [LaTeX Templates](https://github.com/Vivekhaz/latex_professional_docs)

I was thoroughly unsatisfied by the design of available LaTeX templates for résumés and cover letters. So, I designed my own, with inspiration from Butterick's [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com). I encourage you to support his work, and take pride in the details of your own designs.

### Academic

The majority of these projects are not open-sourced, as they are the result of programming assignments from my coursework. It would be unfair to the effort of the instructors and a violation of Dartmouth policy for me to share the code publicly.

#### [FPGA Programming](/projects/cs56_final)

This is an on-going project for the Summer of 2020. I am working with a partner to develop a Hardware Design for an FPGA that will work as synthesizer.

#### [Nuggets, A Networked ASCII Rogue-like in ANSI C](/projects/nuggets)

Nuggets was a group exercise, culminating in a game reminiscent of NetHack. Written in ANSI C, nuggets is played at the terminal, and consisted in a thin client written in `ncurses`, and a multithreaded server hosting the arena.

#### [TSE, a Toy Search Engine Built in ANSI C](/projects/tse)

A project over three assignments, this constitutes a crawler, indexer, and querier. It is an implementation of an abstract structure for a search engine, which scrapes and indexes webpages, and uses an inverted index structure to power a query engine.

#### [A functional subset of X86 (Y86) from Transistors](/projects/y86)

This was the culminating effort of my class in Computer Architecture. Throughout the term, we built iteratively, first simulating the creation of gates from CMOS transistors, up until the final project, where we implemented the Finite State Machine for Y86.

#### [Assorted Introductory Coursework](/projects/intro)

A quick tour of various medium-length programming assignments in Python and Java. Examples include an implementation of Huffman Encoding, A networked document system, a IRC like chatroom using UDP, and an implementation public key encryption.
