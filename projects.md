- Disentanglement of Deterministic Finite Automata


#### Natural Language Processing

## Projects

### Personal



### Academic

The majority of these projects are not open-sourced, as they are the result of programming assignments from my coursework. It would be unfair to the effort of the instructors and a violation of Dartmouth policy for me to share the code publicly. 

#### [Nuggets, A Networked ASCII Rogue-like in ANSI C]()

Nuggets was a group exercise, culminating in a game reminiscent of NetHack. Written in ANSI C, nuggets is played at the terminal, and consisted in a thin client written in ncurses, and a multithreaded server hosting the arena. 

#### [TSE, a Toy Search Engine Built in ANSI C]()

A project over three assignments, this constitutes a crawler, indexer, and querier. It is an implementation of an abstract structure for a search engine, which scrapes and indexes webpages, and uses an inverted index structure to power a query engine. 


#### [A functional subset of X86 (Y86) from Transistors]()

This was the culminating effort of my class in Computer Architecture. Throughout the term, we built iteratively, first simulating the creation of gates from CMOS transistors, up until the final project, where we implemented the Finite State Machine for Y86.

#### [FPGA Programming: ]()


#### [Assorted Introductory Coursework]()

A quick tour of various medium-length programming assignments in Python and Java. Examples include an implementation of Huffman Encoding, A networked document system, a IRC like chatroom using UDP, and an public key encryption.
