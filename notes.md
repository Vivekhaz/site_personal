## Notes

A collection of notes on the courses I've taken, topics I've studied, and other things I'm interested in. Forever in progress.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Course Work
These are my notes for the classes that lend themselves to digital notes. Some of these will link to repos, some to pdfs, and others to course websites.


- [PHIL 38.01: Equality, Justice, and Democracy](https://vivekhaz.github.io/PHIL38/)
- [SOCY 49.01: Theories of Democratization](https://vivekhaz.github.io/SOCY49/)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Papers and Topics
These are annotations on technical papers I've tried to understand, and on broader topics I want to pursue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Links

A public list of bookmarks. These might be blogs, research groups, repos, or anything else which can be found with a URL. I've tried to replace my use of Reddit with RSS and these pages.
