## Links

A 2020 passtime of mine was to curate web pages I liked that aren't from large content platforms. Here is a bit of the result, with some annotations. A list of bookmarks I found helpful or interesting. These might be blogs, research groups, repos, or anything else which can be found with a URL.

### CS Resources
CS-related course websites, texts, and anything else that might fall into this category.

This site was invaluable in quarantine. I haven't been as active recently, but I hope it will have a long tail of relevance as conference talks are streamed.

#### Probability & Statistics
- [Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf)
An excellent textbook in applied statistics. Free to read online.

## Notes

A collection of notes on the courses I've taken, topics I've studied, and other things I'm interested in. Forever in progress.

See also [Intuitive Inference](https://intuitiveinference.com), listed in my projects, for a collaborative effort to explain applied statistics well.

### Course Work
These are my notes for the classes that lend themselves to digital notes. Some of these will link to repos, some to pdfs, and others to course websites.


- [PHIL 38.01: Equality, Justice, and Democracy](https://vivekhaz.github.io/PHIL38/)
- [SOCY 49.01: Theories of Democratization](https://vivekhaz.github.io/SOCY49/)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Papers and Topics
These are annotations on technical papers I've tried to understand, and on broader topics I want to pursue.
