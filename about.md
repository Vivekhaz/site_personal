### Me

<img src="/public/photo-face.jpg" alt="my-face" height="80%" width="80%">

I'm currently studying Computer Science and Philosophy at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, NH. I try to spend much of my free time reading or listening to quality content.

### Fencing

Many of my hours each year have gone to fencing since I started in May 2015. I fence épée, which I started at The Phoenix Center in my home town. I have since continued and now am with Dartmouth College Fencing Club, where I get to practice, compete, and coach. I also was treasurer for the 2019-2020 season, which was unfortunately cut short.

### Reading in 2021
2020 proivided ample time for many of us to catch up on our reading list. Halfway through the year, I found I wasn't having as high of a retention as I would like. I started to read books with the intention of writing a short blurb of my impressions and takeaways. I won't be composing any book reports, but I will try to share some part of that blurb for each book in my 2021 list. 

- __Hackers and Painters__ <cite> by Paul Graham </cite>

I'm guilty of wasting time on Hacker News, so it was inenvitable I sit down and read the essays of Paul Graham, as compiled in his 2004 text. I wish I could claim Graham amongst my pantheon of childhood inspirations, but I wasn't familiar with his influence and rank in the startup ecosystem until 2019. It's a struggle to say anything insightful and coherent about the essays as a whole, but I was struck most by Graham's views on wealth. 

If I could send one essay back to a much younger self, it would be 'Creating Wealth'. Graham's insights on the societal mechanisms which tie wealth and work have not spread far past his sphere of influence in the world of tech startups, but I don't think they're wrong. I am still grappling with the ideas he presents in the essay that follows, 'Mind the Gap'. While I struggle to point out flaws in his premises, I cannot as easily go along with his conclusion that variation in income is a sign of health in a democratic society. I think I agree with the idea in isolation and to some degree, but I think a. that the degree of inequality in America in 2021 is making a difference in scale a difference in kind, and b. that wealth taxation is not inherently wrong, which Graham dismisses it as. 

I recommend the book to anyone with an interest in how some subsections of the world *really* work. I also caution against dogmatically accepting Graham's ideas, but instead digesting them and accepting the ones which you believe give you the most accurate view of the world.

### Reading in 2020
A list of the books I was able to complete in 2020. I thought it would be best to omit the technical books I read for now, but I will probably compile a list of O'Reilly books I used to supplement my liberal arts CS education when I graduate. These were all the books where I would recommend sitting down with a coffee and going through, if the opportunity finds you. I'm not sentimental about finishing books and movies that I start but don't enjoy, so I would describe all of these as "page-turners". I use the term loosely.

### Read in 2019
Since starting my undergrad, I've tried to be more mindful about the books I'm consuming *outside* of my assigned readings, since free time has become ever scarce. I'm dissatisfied with the length of this list, but I hope having it on display pushes me to do more in 2020. In an effort to keep my consumption up, here is a list of the books I was able to finish in 2019.
