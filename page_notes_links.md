## Notes

A collection of the notes I've taken on the courses I've taken, topics I've studied, and other things I'm interested in. Forever in progress.

## Links

A collection of webpages I've interested in, or found interesting at some point. I've tried to replace my use of Reddit with RSS and these pages.
