### Me

<img src="/public/photo-face.jpg" alt="my-face" hieght="50%" width="50%">

I'm currently studying at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, NH. I try to spend much of my free time reading or listening to quality content. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Fencing

Many of my hours each year have gone to fencing since I started in May 2015. I fence epee, which I started at The Phoenix Center in my home town. I have since continued and now practice with Dartmouth College Fencing Club, where I get to practice, compete, and coach. I also was treasurer for the 2019-2020 season, which was unfortuantely cut short.

### Reading in 2020
A running list of what I've completed, have in progress, or want to get through by the end of 2020. Hopefully, none of these wind up pushed back to the 2021 list.

### Read in 2019
Since starting my undergrad, I've tried to be more mindful about the books I'm consuming *outside* of my assigned readings, since free time has become ever scarce. I'm dissatisfied with the length of this list, but I hope having it on display pushes me to do more in 2020. In an effort to keep my consumption up, here is a list of the books I was able to finish in 2019.
