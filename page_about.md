### Me

<img src="/public/photo-face.jpg" alt="my-face" hieght="50%" width="50%">

I'm currently studying at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, NH.  I try to spend much of my free time reading or listening to quality content.

### Fencing

Many of my hours each year have gone to fencing since I started in May 2015. I fence epee, which I started at The Phoenix Center in my home town. I have since continued and now practice with Dartmouth College Fencing Club, where I get to practice, compete, and coach. I also was treasurer for the 2019-2020 season, which was unfortuantely cut short.

### Read in 2019
Since starting my undergrad, I've tried to be more mindful about the books I'm consuming *outside* of my assigned readings, since free time has become ever scarce. I'm dissatisfied with the length of this list, but I hope having it on display pushes me to do more in 2020. In an effort to keep my consumption up, here is a list of the books I was able to finish in 2019.
