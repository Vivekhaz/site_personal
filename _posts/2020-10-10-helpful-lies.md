title: The Lies that Make the Universe Spin
published: false

The concept of 'Helpful Lies of the Universe' has turned over in my head for some number of years now. Until recently, I hadn't connected it to any broader trends in society, but used it as a way to explain inconsistencies and cognitive dissonances that I saw in my life. Having (finally) read Peter Thiel's *Zero to One*, I think I can connect my mental framework to the **Contrarian Mindset** in the Entrepreneurial world. 

When I think of helpful lies, I think of a range of thoughts, from superstitions to mantras like "hard work pays off." In almost every case where my skepticism is triggered, I can find a helpful lie lurking near by. The reality is, humanity isn't stupid, at least not in aggregate. Our epistemology might be *inadequate*, but the mechanisms we have built to pass generational knowledge down don't entirely suck.

One of my earliest encounters with a helpful lie was at home. In my immigrant household, we weren't suppose to cut our nails at night. The explanation my mom gave to six-year old me? BhÅ«mi Mata (The Indian Goddess of Earth) would be irritated with me, and so would my mom.

I pressed on with the venerable question 'Why?', like children of that age do. Eventually, I irritated my mother *without cutting my nails at night*. The truth was laid bare. She told me that people in India of generations past didn't cut their nails at night because they didn't always have light readily available, and like legos, toenails are unpleasant to step on. Duh.

Most superstitions are quite reasonable, if you have the charity to interpret them in their original context. 

What about lies given to us by institutions? Why do we learn to work hard in school,
